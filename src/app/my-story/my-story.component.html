        <p>
            There was a young boy who grew up to be a great wizard. The son of a minor lord from a small fiefdom, Andrew was taught from a young age to have a love of reading and learning. He read from dawn til dusk, his parents happy to supply him an endless amount of books. The young prince was taught to be confident and bold, but also thoughtul, reflective, and kind. As he grew up, he found he loved to build things. The joy of creating something with his own hands and watching something take shape from his mind's eye held no compare. And luckily for him, he lived in an age that was the dawn of endless creation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>For at this time, the great "computer" (A type of magic to be sure) was invented, but only great wizards could weild it's power. Seeing all this wonder, Andrew was overcome with curiosity and lust for understanding. At the bright young age of 14, he began to study the ancient texts of <span class="link">freeCodeCamp.com</span>. He poured over it for months and months until he felt he had acheived true understanding. His thirst for knowledge satiated for now, Andrew went back to learning about how to rule a kingdom.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Years went by, and every few months he would think about it, and dabble a little bit into the world of magic and wizardry. But Andrew grew up the son of a king, and as much as he excelled at magic, he was actually better at ruling a kingdom. So when it came time, Andrew went off to a great university called Cleveland State University to study how to rule a kingdom (business school). But he continued to work on his magic during his free time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, during his third year of university, a great plague struck the land. An evil known to the people as COVID-19. The whole kingdom was forced to stay in their homes for over a year! With nothing better to do, Andrew decided to keep learning magic. He enjoyed ruling, but there was an ever present hunger for magic that he needed to satisfy. During this great plague, Andrew studied his magic for hours every day. He would sit down with a problem and not get up until he had finished it, studying until the sun had started to come up if he had to.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Around the time when the plague was ending, Andrew worked for a small business that made pizzas. Andrew's task was to deliver the pizzas to their loyal customers. He liked this job because he could keep studying when he wasn't delivering food, he would bring in his spellbook (computer) and practice during the slow times at the shop. One day, Andrew learned that his boss was splitting off from the main company and starting his own pizza shop! With a new name, new branding... and a new website. It was Andrew's big opportunity to practice everything he had been learning. With great anticipation, Andrew went to have a conversation with his boss, pleading with his boss to let him cast this great spell. He was ready for it! To his surprise, his boss agreed! Setting out on your own as a new business was tough enough, the boss was happy to let Andrew work his magic...</p>
        <br>
        <p>And so he did! Andrew got to work and over the course of the next month Andrew cast a great spell, a mighty spell that stretched him to his limits. When he was finished, his magic helped his boss's business expand like never before. With the power of magic the new venture proved to be quite successful!</p>
        <br>
        <p>.So successful in fact, that Andrew began to believe his true calling was to be a wizard. He was <span>GOOD</span> at it, and furthermore, he enjoyed it thuroughly. And so Andrew began to do more magic. With the proof of his abilities shown in the pizza shop, Andrew moved on from the shop, and became a professional wizard. Just small projects at first for the local townspeople, but eventually his work gained a reputation, and he drew the attention of a higher power...</p>
        <br>
        <p>With only one year left at kingdom ruling school, Andrew was also working part-time as a freelance wizard for whichever townspeople needed him. He had comleted several projects when the wizard council of Softrams took notice of him. "Join us, and we will make you more powerful than you could ever imagine" they said. And Andrew lept at the opportunity. Joining a wizard's council like Softrams would give him access to such knowledge that he could only dream of. But! He couldn't be a great wizard AND rule a kingdom, he would have to choose. A great battle weighed inside him. Follow his passion? Or his destiny? Decisions, decisions...</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, Andrew decided to join the Softrams wizard's council. It was too good an opportunity to pass up, and Andrew could always go back to university to finish his kingdom ruling degree.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Andrew rose quickly in the council. He had joined the council as a Junior magician, but only six months later he was promoted to a mid-level wizard, for Andrew had taken on great challenges with the council and overcome all of them. Teammates leaving, sick teammates in times of great impending deadlines, and simply casting spells so powerful on his own granted him a quick path to the next level. But Andrew was not done shooting up the ladder. Oh no, he had become an ambitious young wizard. Just two months after being made a mid-level wizard, the head wizard sat down and had a talk with Andrew. Andrew's team had performed extremely poorly the last quarter, and rumor amongst the chief wizard's was that Andrew had some ideas about how to fix the team. Andrew himself had performed admirably, and he had a reputation for being a great communicator and facilitator for his fellow wizards. Andrew explained to the head wizard his plan to fix his team, for Andrew knew what was wrong, and was a natural leader. He knew what needed to be done. The conversation ended with one comand from the head wizard. "Take control of your team Andrew, they are yours now. Lead them down the path of success"</p>
        <br>
        <p>Faced with the daunting task of leading a team much older and more experienced than him, Andrew spent hours and hours thinking of how to do such a thing. He knew he was being given a great opportunity, and he could not waste it. Andrew was born to lead a kingdom, surely he could lead one single team. A great task to be sure, but Andrew was bold, and confident in his skills. Even though the team had two great tasks ahead of it, dealing with magic they had never seen before and deadlines that were way too soon, Andrew led his team throughout it all. And when the fire was put out and the dust was settled, Andrew's team was the highest performing team on the whole council. Andrew was surrounded by motivated, hungry teammates. But they lacked direction and cohesion, Andrew provided that, and working together they became the council's ace squad, summoning magics to the likes no one had seen before.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Things were going well, and the future looked bright. But other council's had begun to notice Andrew as well. Council's far more powerful and ancient and noble than Softrams. In fact, the greatest of wizard council's, Google, had taken notice...</p>
